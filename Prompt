For this assignment you will be working in pairs. We are simply practicing our algorithmic problem solving with various javascript problems that are efficiently solved using the algorithmic frameworks discussed in class today.

We really want to practice the problem solving process so much that it is second nature to us.  The attached document has the process you should be using.

DUE 10am Monday.  There will be no extensions for this assignment!! (afterhours tutoring is your best friend this weekend!)

Both students will create repos for this assignment and submit.  

Deliverables:

Your solutions MUST have pseudocode!! (commented out in your code)
You must use either cyclic sort or fast/slow pointer algorithm to solve
You must solve at least 3 problems from set A and 3 problems from set B
You must have testing! Have at least one or two test cases to verify each of your solutions.


Set A:

1. Find the Missing Number

Problem Description: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the missing number.

2. Find All Duplicates in an Array

Problem Description: Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements that appear twice in the array.

3.: Set Mismatch

Problem Description: You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in the repetition of one number and the loss of another number. You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

4.First Missing Positive

Problem Description: Given an unsorted integer array nums, find the smallest missing positive integer.

5. Find the Duplicate Number

Problem Description: Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is only one duplicate number in nums, return this duplicate number.

6. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Problem Description: Given an array of integers nums containing n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n]. Return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

Set B:

1.Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Problem Description: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

2. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Problem Description: Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

3. Find the Duplicate Number

Problem Description: Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is only one duplicate number in nums, return this duplicate number.

5. Container With Most Water

Problem Description: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn, and the two endpoints of the line i are at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, forms a container that contains the most water.

6. Subarray Sum Equals K

Problem Description: Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.
